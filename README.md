# 🖧 Local Area Network (LAN) Design

## 🔒 Overview
This project demonstrates a structured approach to designing a secure Local Area Network (LAN) infrastructure. The goal was to create a logically segmented and well-protected network that supports efficient communication between internal components and external resources.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Google Cybersecurity Certificate (Interactive Simulation Lab)
- Visual Network Design Interface

## 🧩 Network Components
- **Internet**
- **Firewall (External)** – Controls traffic entering the network
- **Router** – Directs internal traffic between segments
- **Firewall (Internal)** – Adds an additional security layer
- **Server** – Hosts services and applications
- **Switch** – Manages internal wired connections
- **Wireless Access Point (WAP)** – Provides Wi-Fi access to authorized devices

## 🔐 Key Security Practices Applied
- Layered security using two firewalls (external + internal)
- Proper segmentation: separating internet-facing and internal assets
- Secure placement of access points to control wireless access
- Server placed behind firewall to prevent direct internet exposure

## 📈 Outcome
The final LAN architecture provides a secure, scalable, and organized framework that reflects core network design and cybersecurity principles. It highlights my understanding of secure network layout, device placement, and traffic flow.
